* Initial commit. Still WIP.

* Added more test cases.

* More test data. Start of some documentation.

* Added some error handling around parsing.

* Changed message to be required.

* Changed to copy any field that matches on name and type. Updated documentation.

* Added Jenkinsfile

* Updated documentation.

* Good catch by @cjmatta. Since I'm switching the topics for the new data, there could be a different number of partitions. Retaining the original partition could cause issues. Setting to null so it's recalculated.

* Changed the parsing logic to match changes from the cef parsing library. Cleanup of formatting.

* Added target to ignore

* Added example config.

* Changed the version to 0.10.2.0-cp1

* Changed the parent to 0.10.2.0-cp1."
