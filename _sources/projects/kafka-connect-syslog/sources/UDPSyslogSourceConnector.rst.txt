UDPSyslogSourceConnector
========================

.. image:: UDPSyslogSourceConnector.svg


Connector is used to receive syslog messages over UDP.


.. IMPORTANT::
    This connector listens on a network port. Running more than one task or running in distributed mode can cause some undesired effects if another task already has the port open. It is recommended that you run this connector in :term:`Standalone Mode`.

Property based example

This configuration is used typically along with `standalone mode
<http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/concepts.html#standalone-workers>`_.

.. code-block:: properties

    name=connector1
    tasks.max=1
    connector.class=com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.syslog.UDPSyslogSourceConnector
    # The following values must be configured.
    kafka.topic=



^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rest based example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This configuration is used typically along with `distributed mode
<http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/concepts.html#distributed-workers>`_.
Write the following json to `connector.json`, configure all of the required values, and use the command below to
post the configuration to one the distributed connect worker(s).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "connector1",
        "config": {
            "connector.class": "com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.syslog.UDPSyslogSourceConnector",
            "kafka.topic":"",
        }
    }

Use curl to post the configuration to one of the Kafka Connect Workers. Change `http://localhost:8083/` the the endpoint of
one of your Kafka Connect worker(s).

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
