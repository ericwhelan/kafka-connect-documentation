    name=connector1
    tasks.max=1

Rest based example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This configuration is used typically along with `distributed mode
<http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/concepts.html#distributed-workers>`_.
Write the following json to `connector.json`, configure all of the required values, and use the command below to
post the configuration to one the distributed connect worker(s).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "connector1",
        "config": {
            "connector.class": "com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.solr.CloudSolrSinkConnector",
            "solr.collection.name":"",
            "solr.zookeeper.hosts":"",
        }
    }

Use curl to post the configuration to one of the Kafka Connect Workers. Change `http://localhost:8083/` the the endpoint of
one of your Kafka Connect worker(s).

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
