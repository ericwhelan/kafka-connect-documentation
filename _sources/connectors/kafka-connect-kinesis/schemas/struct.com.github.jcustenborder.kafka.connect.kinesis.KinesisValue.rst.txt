KinesisValue
============

The unit of data of the Amazon Kinesis stream, which is composed of a sequence number, a partition key, and a data blob. See [Record](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/model/Record.html)

    "sequenceNumber",":ref:`schema-String`","true","","The unique identifier of the record in the stream. See [Record.getSequenceNumber()](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/model/Record.html#getSequenceNumber--)"
    "approximateArrivalTimestamp",":ref:`schema-Int64`","true","","The approximate time that the record was inserted into the stream. See [Record.getApproximateArrivalTimestamp()](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/model/Record.html#getApproximateArrivalTimestamp--)"
    "data",":ref:`schema-Bytes`","true","","The data blob. See [Record.getData()](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/model/Record.html#getData--)"
    "partitionKey",":ref:`schema-String`","true","","A partition key is used to group data by shard within a stream. The Streams service segregates the data records belonging to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 bytes. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. A partition key is specified by the applications putting the data into a stream. Identifies which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. See [Record.getPartitionKey()](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/model/Record.html#getPartitionKey--)"
    "shardId",":ref:`schema-String`","true","","A shard is a uniquely identified group of data records in a stream. A stream is composed of one or more shards, each of which provides a fixed unit of capacity. Each shard can support up to 5 transactions per second for reads, up to a maximum total data read rate of 2 MB per second and up to 1,000 records per second for writes, up to a maximum total data write rate of 1 MB per second (including partition keys). The data capacity of your stream is a function of the number of shards that you specify for the stream. The total capacity of the stream is the sum of the capacities of its shards."
    "streamName",":ref:`schema-String`","true","","The name of the Kinesis stream."
