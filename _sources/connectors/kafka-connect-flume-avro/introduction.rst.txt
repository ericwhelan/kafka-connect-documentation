Flume Connector
===============

The Flume connector provides a method to recieve data from `Apache Flume <https://flume.apache.org/>` using the
`Flume Avro Source <https://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#avro-source>` to receive the events as they are transmitted
from Flume to a Kafka Connect Worker.
